Explanation
===========

This library is meant to assist users who want to get text from the console.
For many users, using the built-in raw_input in insufficient as it does not
support editing the text on the line, nor does it offer command history. The
GNU Readline Project is the obvious answer for many when confronted with this
problem. However, GNU Readline is licensed under the GPL so it only makes since
if you are writing "copylefted" GPL compatable software. I am releasing Getline
under a BSD style license. If you are using it and would like more features, or
more supported platforms, let me know!

Currently I am supporting the Linux Platform, and I hope to have a Windows
implementation shortly. If anyone has a Mac and would like to assist me in
supporting that platform as well please email me. If one of your targeted
platforms is not yet supported never fear, getline will still work with reduced
functionality by using raw_input.
